<div class="cc-col">	<p class="fact_title"> What is the Dew Point and Why is it so Important?</p>
	<p class="fact_body"> You have probably heard meteorologists talk about
 the dew point and you wondered what impact that it has on the weather. 
The dew point is very important in many ways. It affects whether you 
will have to clean the frost off your windshield in the morning. The dew
 point determines how uncomfortable you will feel on a warm summer day. 
It determines whether it will rain or snow. The dew point determines how
 high the danger is for a grass or brush fire during a dry spell. That�s
 just a few reasons why it is so significant. The definition of dew 
point is as follows: The dew point is the temperature at which the 
moisture (water vapor) in the air begins to condense. The warmer the air
 is, the more moisture it can hold. I always use the glass of water 
comparison to explain this. Let�s say you have two glasses, one large 
the other small. Since warmer air can hold more water vapor, the large 
glass represents the warm air. If you fill the smaller glass (which 
represents the cold air) to 90% full and you pour it into the larger 
glass, the percentage of water in the larger glass will be much less 
than the small glass was. Since the opposite will be true, let�s say 
that the large glass was 90% full and you poured the water into the 
smaller glass. It will overflow, won�t it? That overflowing represents 
condensation, when the air just cannot hold the water vapor in its 
invisible gaseous form and it turns into visible water droplets. You can
 literally see the dew point in action during cold, damp weather. When 
you breathe out, the air coming out of your lungs is very warm. As this 
air hits the colder air outside your body, the invisible water vapor 
immediately condenses and you see the �cloud� in front of your face. Why
 does it condense? The colder air cannot hold the water vapor and it 
releases it immediately. This �cloud� consists of tiny drops of moisture
 that are suspended in the air. In the real clouds in the sky, it�s the 
same principle. On a summer day, when the sun heats the ground, the air 
immediately above the ground also warms up. Since warm air is lighter 
than cold air above it, it rises into the sky. As it rises, the air 
cools until it reaches the temperature that it can no longer hold the 
water vapor. That temperature is the dew point. Then, a cloud forms. You
 might ask - Why does dew (or frost) form on my car but there is no fog?
 The reason is that the temperature of the surface of your car is cooler
 than the surrounding air and yes, it has to be at or below the dew 
point even though the air is not at or below the dew point outside. Once
 the air temperature reaches the dew point, fog will form. The reason 
the dew point is important during the warmer months is this. When you 
perspire, the water on your skin evaporates and cools your body. This is
 the body�s natural temperature regulating system at work. When the dew 
point is high, the evaporation rate is very slow because there is so 
much water vapor in the air, and you don�t get the cooling effect from 
your wet skin. The dew point also affects how you feel when you get out 
of a pool, lake or the ocean. On those days when the dew point is very 
low, you will feel cooler than when the dew point is high. This is 
because when the dew point is low, the water on your skin evaporates 
faster thus cooling you off. I hope this explanation helps you 
understand the importance of the dew point.</p>
